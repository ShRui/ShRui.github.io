#### Master Candidate of Biostatistics, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health


I received a BS in Bioengineering from [Huazhong Agriculture University](http://www.hzau.edu.cn) in 2017. 

My graduation thesis was advised by [Dr. Xinguang Chen](http://epidemiology.phhp.ufl.edu/people/faculty-staff/faculty/core-faculty/xinguang-jim-chen/) in [University of Florida Department of Epidemiology](http://epidemiology.phhp.ufl.edu) , and the topic is "Information Diffusion Theory in Assessing the Influence of Medical Marijuana Law on Juvenile Risk Behaviors". 

I went to [Columbia Mailman School of Public health](http://www.mailman.columbia.edu/) in fall 2017 to take a master-degree program in [Biostatistics](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/become-student/departments/biostatistics).
